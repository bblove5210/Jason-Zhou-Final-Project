Execute Course_Schedule_Manager to test the program.

Since there is user creation functionality, I've premade some users in the system.
Their username and password can be found in Users folder.
Among them, admin has the administrator role.

I've also created some sample courses based on some real NYU courses, but of course more can be created.
